=== Triggers Support


The plugin allows configuring the CloudBees CD to poll the specified source control repository for updates with a preconfigured schedule.
If an update is detected, the pipeline or release object will run.

The Polling schedule is managed by the `PropertyPollingTrigger` located in the *Electric Cloud* project.

After the Trigger with a type 'Polling' is created, the schedule will check the specified CloudBees CD property.

For configuring use the documentation xref:pipelines:event-based-triggers.adoc[Event-based triggers#Polling Triggers].

IMPORTANT: Schedule `PollingTriggers` should be enabled.

. Go to menu:DevOps Essentials[Platform Home page].
. Select *Electric Cloud* from the *Projects* tab.
. Select the *Schedules* tab and enable the `PropertyPollingTrigger`.
